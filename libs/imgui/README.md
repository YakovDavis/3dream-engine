CMake support for ImGui
=======================

**Note: This repo is abandoned, I'm using https://github.com/tamaskenez/allthesmallthings now.**

ImGui has been designed to be used without CMake or any other
build tool, by simply adding the ImGui source files to your project.

In case it fits your workflow better you can use ImGui just like
any other CMake-enabled library. To allow for the same customization features
(`imconfig.h`) as without CMake, ImGui will be added to your project as
a set of source files and not as an actual compiled library.

The actual [ImGui repository](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) is referred as a
submodule. The submodule tracks the master branch of the
[ImGui repo](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) which means it's still tied to a specific
commit but it's easier to update. So you can always execute:

```shell
git submodule update --remote
```

to get the latest commits before configuring/installing the library.

This repo contains a test script `./cmake-testbuild.sh` which builds the
ImGui CMake-project (this directory) then builds the OpenGL/GLFW examples
in separate build trees. The script is tested on MacOSX, Linux, Windows. The
ImGui library itself (which has no OpenGL and GLFW dependencies) will
work on a wider range of platforms.

It also contains an additional `imconfig_example` which demonstrates using
a custom `imconfig.h`.

### Donating

If you're using ImGui in your projects, please consider supporting its
development. For details see the [README.md](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/README.md)
of the ImGui project.

Usage:
------

Configure and install the `CMakeLists.txt` in this directory to create the
`imgui-config.cmake` config-module. Then,

- with CMake version 3.3 or later:

```cmake
find_package(imgui REQUIRED)
...
target_link_libraries(<my-target> ... imgui ...)
```

- with CMake versions 2.8.12 - 3.2

```cmake
find_package(imgui REQUIRED)
...
add_exutable(<my-target> ... ${IMGUI_SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(<my-target> ... imgui ...)
```

The first method requires the CMake target property `INTERFACE_SOURCES` which
is implemented completely only in V3.3.

For a quick test of the CMake build and also as an example check out
`cmake-testbuild.sh` in this directory.

Customization
-------------

To use a custom `imconfig.h`,

- copy `include/imconfig-sample.h` from the install directory to your project and
  edit it

- define `IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMCONFIG_H` in your project and add its path:

        target_compile_definitions(<my-target> PRIVATE IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMCONFIG_H)
        target_include_directories(<my-target> PRIVATE <path-to-imgui.h>)

Also, see `./examples/imconfig_example`
